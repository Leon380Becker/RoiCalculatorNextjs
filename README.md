üìÑ Project Overview
This project is a client-side ROI calculator that allows users to:

Fill in a form with their name and email

Automatically generate and download a PDF with the calculated results

Send the name and email directly to HubSpot as new Contacts (via the backend API)

All calculations are handled client-side. The only backend functionality is for sending submissions to HubSpot.

‚öôÔ∏è Backend API Endpoint
The backend logic for sending user data to HubSpot is implemented in the following API route:

File: /pages/api/save-user.ts

This API:

Accepts POST requests

Expects a JSON body with name and email

Sends the data to HubSpot CRM via the official API

Requires a valid HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN in your environment variables

üîê Configure Environment Variables
To use the HubSpot API, you need to set the following environment variable:

env
Copy
Edit
HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_private_app_token_here
This can be done either:

Locally (create a .env.local file in the root of the project)

On Vercel (go to your project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables)

üõ† Install Dependencies
If you're setting this up from scratch or handing off to a new developer, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
This installs required dependencies such as:

next, react, react-dom ‚Äî core framework packages

Any additional API packages used to connect to HubSpot

üíª Development Setup
1. Recommended: Install Visual Studio Code
VS Code is the preferred editor for this project. It provides:

Easy .env management

Git integration

Extensions for formatting and debugging

2. Run the Development Server
To start the project locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Your app should be available at http://localhost:3000

üßÆ Calculation Logic
All calculation formulas and helper functions used in the ROI calculator live in the /helpers folder.

This folder contains modular JavaScript or TypeScript files that:

Receive inputs from the user form (Calculator inputs)

Calculate financial metrics or return on investment values

Provide formatted data to the PDF builder and UI components

These are imported and used directly in the form submission logic and PDF generation process.

üì© Form Submission + PDF Download
The popup form:

Collects user input (name, email)

Sends data to /api/save-user to create a new HubSpot contact

Automatically generates and triggers a PDF download with the calculated data

‚úÖ No server-side rendering or server-side PDF generation is used ‚Äî everything runs on the client.

üîí Security Notes
.env.local must be listed in .gitignore

Access tokens must never be committed to GitHub

Only POST is allowed on the /api/save-user endpoint (already enforced in code)

üîó HubSpot Integration Guide
